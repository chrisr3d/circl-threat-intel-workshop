    "# MISP & PyMISP - Threat Intelligence Analysis Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MISP?\n",
    "\n",
    "MISP is an open-source threat intelligence platform designed for sharing, storing, and correlating Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and threat intelligence data. Originally developed by CIRCL, MISP has become a cornerstone of collaborative cybersecurity efforts worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core MISP Concepts and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Events and Attributes\n",
    "- **Events**: Container objects that represent security incidents, campaigns, or threat intelligence reports\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Individual pieces of threat intelligence (IP addresses, domains, file hashes, URLs, etc.)\n",
    "- **Objects**: Complex structures that group related attributes together (e.g., a file object containing hash, filename, and size)\n",
    "- **Relationships**: Connections between events, attributes, and objects that show how threats relate to each other\n",
    "\n",
    "### MISP Galaxies and Taxonomies\n",
    "- **Taxonomies**: Classification systems used to tag and categorize threat intelligence\n",
    "- **Tags**: Labels applied to events and attributes using taxonomies and galaxy information\n",
    "- **Galaxies**: Knowledge bases containing structured threat intelligence (threat actors, attack patterns, tools, etc.)\n",
    "- **Clusters**: Specific entries within galaxies (e.g., \"APT29\" within the threat-actor galaxy)\n",
    "\n",
    "### MITRE ATT&CK Integration\n",
    "- **Techniques**: Specific attack methods catalogued in the MITRE ATT&CK framework\n",
    "- **Tactics**: High-level categories of attack behavior (e.g., Persistence, Defense Evasion)\n",
    "- **Procedures**: Specific implementations of techniques by threat actors\n",
    "- **Sub-techniques**: More granular variations of main techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## PyMISP Library\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMISP is the official Python library for interacting with MISP instances:\n",
    "- **API Wrapper**: Provides Python methods for all MISP API endpoints\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented**: Represents MISP data as Python objects for easy manipulation\n",
    "- **Search Capabilities**: Powerful querying with filters, boolean logic, and temporal ranges\n",
    "- **Data Export**: Multiple formats for integration with other security tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of MISP\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threat Intelligence Sharing\n",
    "- **Community Collaboration**: Share IOCs and threat data across organizations\n",
    "- **Automated Feeds**: Consume and distribute threat intelligence through standardized formats\n",
    "- **Access Control**: Granular permissions for data sharing and visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Correlation\n",
    "- **Automatic Correlation**: MISP automatically identifies relationships between similar attributes\n",
    "- **Manual Relationships**: Analysts can create explicit connections between threats\n",
    "- **Contextual Enrichment**: Add metadata and context to raw threat indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration Capabilities\n",
    "- **API Access**: RESTful API for programmatic access and automation\n",
    "- **Export Formats**: STIX, CSV, JSON, XML, and custom formats\n",
    "- **SIEM Integration**: Direct feeds to security information and event management systems\n",
    "\n",

    "### PyMISP Setup and Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can query MISP for threat intelligence, we need to establish a connection to a MISP instance. This process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authentication Requirements:**\n",
    "- **API Key (AuthKey)**: A unique identifier that grants access to the MISP instance\n",
    "- **Base URL**: The web address of the MISP server\n",
    "- **SSL Configuration**: Security settings for encrypted communication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Instance Details:**\n",
    "For this workshop, we'll use the community training instance at `https://training.misp-community.org`. This is a public MISP instance designed for learning and testing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Considerations:**\n",
    "- API keys provide access equivalent to your user account permissions\n",
    "- Never share API keys or commit them to version control\n",
    "- The training instance uses self-signed certificates, requiring SSL verification bypass\n",
    "- In production environments, proper SSL certificates should be used\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection Process:**\n",
    "The code below will authenticate with the MISP instance and verify the connection by retrieving version information."
