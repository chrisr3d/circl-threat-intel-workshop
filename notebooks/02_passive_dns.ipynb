    "- Reverse DNS lookups (PTR records) \n",
    "- Mail server information (MX records)\n",
    "- Name server data (NS records)\n",
    "- Historical timeline of DNS changes\n",
    "- First and last seen timestamps for all records\n",
    "\n",

    "### PassiveDNS API Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin exploring PassiveDNS data, we need to set up our authentication credentials. The PassiveDNS service requires user authentication to access the comprehensive DNS record database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- Valid PassiveDNS account credentials\n",
    "- Network access to https://www.circl.lu\n",
    "- Python pypdns library (should be pre-installed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup Instructions:**\n",
    "1. Obtain your PassiveDNS username and API key from your account\n",
    "2. Run the cell below to securely input your credentials\n",
    "3. The PyPDNS client will be configured for all subsequent API calls\n",

    "### Exercise 1.4: Extract Unique IP Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Identify all unique IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) associated with a domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding IP Address Analysis:**\n",
    "Extracting unique IP addresses from DNS records reveals:\n",
    "- **Current Infrastructure:** Active IP addresses serving the domain\n",
    "- **Historical Infrastructure:** Previous hosting locations and migrations\n",
    "- **Redundancy:** Multiple IPs indicating load balancing or failover\n",
    "- **Geographic Distribution:** Different IPs potentially serving different regions\n",
    "\n",
    "**A vs AAAA Records:**\n",
    "- **A Records:** Map to IPv4 addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1)\n",
    "- **AAAA Records:** Map to IPv6 addresses (e.g., 2001:db8::1)\n",
    "- **Both Types:** Indicate dual-stack networking support\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why IP Collection Matters:**\n",
    "- **Threat Intelligence:** Build lists of IPs associated with domains of interest\n",
    "- **Network Security:** Create allowlists or blocklists based on domain associations\n",
    "- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Track changes in hosting providers or locations\n",
    "- **Incident Response:** Quickly identify all IPs that might be affected\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Findings:**\n",
    "- **Single IP:** Simple hosting setup\n",
    "- **Multiple IPv4:** Load balancing or CDN usage\n",
    "- **IPv4 + IPv6:** Modern dual-stack configuration\n",
    "- **Many IPs:** Large-scale infrastructure or CDN\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:**\n",
    "- Set of unique IPv4 addresses from A records\n",
    "- Set of unique IPv6 addresses from AAAA records (if any)\n",
    "- Total count of unique IP addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Questions:**\n",
    "- How many unique IPs serve this domain?\n",
    "- Is IPv6 supported alongside IPv4?\n",
    "- Do the IPs suggest load balancing or CDN usage?"
