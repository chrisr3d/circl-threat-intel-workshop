    "# PassiveSSH Analysis Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "PassiveSSH is a powerful passive reconnaissance tool that collects and indexes SSH banners and host key fingerprints from internet-wide scans. This data can be invaluable for threat intelligence, security research, and infrastructure analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is PassiveSSH?\n",
    "\n",
    "PassiveSSH provides historical and current information about SSH services across the internet, including:\n",
    "- SSH banner information (versions, implementations)\n",
    "- Host key fingerprints and their associated hosts\n",
    "- Historical data showing changes over time\n",
    "- Correlation between different SSH characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Main Documentation: https://d4-project.github.io/passive-ssh/\n",
    "- API Reference: Available through the web interface\n",
    "- Data Sources: Internet-wide SSH scans and honeypot data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Query SSH banner information and understand its significance\n",
    "2. Identify hosts using specific SSH banners\n",
    "3. Retrieve detailed SSH information for specific hosts\n",
    "4. Track historical changes in SSH configurations\n",

    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Understand the scope and diversity of SSH implementations across the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are SSH Banners?**\n",
    "SSH banners are identification strings sent by SSH servers during the initial connection handshake. They typically contain:\n",

    "- Software implementation name and version\n",
    "- Sometimes additional identifying information\n",

    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- Different SSH implementations have different security characteristics\n",
    "- Banner analysis can help identify outdated or vulnerable SSH servers\n",

    "**Objective:** Identify all hosts that share the same SSH host key fingerprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are SSH Host Key Fingerprints?**\n",
    "SSH host key fingerprints are cryptographic hashes of a server's public keys. They serve as unique identifiers and are used for:\n",
    "- **Server Authentication:** Clients verify they're connecting to the correct server\n",
    "- **Man-in-the-Middle Detection:** Changed fingerprints indicate potential attacks\n",
    "- **Infrastructure Correlation:** Multiple hosts sharing keys suggests common management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Multiple Hosts Share Fingerprints:**\n",
    "- **Load Balancers:** Multiple servers behind a load balancer may share keys\n",
    "- **Virtual Machine Cloning:** VMs cloned from the same template inherit SSH keys\n",
    "- **Configuration Management:** Automated deployment tools may distribute the same keys\n",
    "- **Compromised Infrastructure:** Attackers might reuse SSH keys across multiple systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Implications:**\n",
    "- **Legitimate Sharing:** Common in properly managed infrastructure\n",
    "- **Security Risk:** Shared keys increase the impact of key compromise\n",
    "- **Threat Intelligence:** Unusual sharing patterns may indicate malicious infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "**About This Fingerprint:**\n",
    "The fingerprint `f2:90:ec:c6:49:fd:fc:98:70:d8:60:db:47:97:09:6a` represents an MD5 hash of an SSH host key. We'll discover how many hosts present this same key.\n",

    "- How many hosts share this fingerprint?\n",

    "### Task - Pivot from banners to hosts and fingerprints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a banner from the output of Exercise 1.0 (for example `SSH-2.0-GIfQrwMLPdNQT99`).\n",
    "2. Query the hosts for that banner (`/banner/hosts/[banner]`) and collect up to 5 IPs.\n",
    "3. For each selected IP:\n",
    "    - Fetch full SSH info (`/host/ssh/[ip]`) and record: banner, host key fingerprints, key types, first_seen, last_seen.\n",
    "    - Fetch historical data (`/host/history/[ip]`) and record number of historical records and any banner changes.\n",
    "4. For every fingerprint you find, query `/fingerprint/all/[fingerprint]` to see if the same key appears on other hosts.\n",
    "5. Produce a short report (3–5 bullets) summarizing:\n",
    "    - How many hosts used the banner and how many you inspected\n",
    "    - Any unusual banners or multiple key types found\n",
    "    - Evidence of shared fingerprints (and possible explanations: load balancer, VM cloning, or misconfiguration)\n",

    "- Reuse the `pssh` session already created in the notebook.\n",
    "- Use `.json()` on responses and handle HTTP/errors gracefully.\n",
