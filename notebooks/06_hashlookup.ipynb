    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Learn how to retrieve comprehensive file intelligence for a specific hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Hash-Based File Intelligence:**\n",
    "Cryptographic hashes serve as unique fingerprints for files, enabling:\n",
    "- **File Identification**: Uniquely identify files regardless of name or location\n",
    "- **Integrity Verification**: Confirm files haven't been modified or corrupted\n",
    "- **Threat Detection**: Identify known malicious files through their hashes\n",
    "- **Duplicate Detection**: Find identical files across different systems or networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hash Types Supported:**\n",
    "- **MD5**: 32-character hexadecimal string (legacy but widely used)\n",
    "- **SHA-1**: 40-character hexadecimal string (more secure than MD5)\n",
    "- **SHA-256**: 64-character hexadecimal string (current security standard)\n",
    "\n",
    "**About This Hash:**\n",
    "The MD5 hash `aaade8e2a921e9ac40178a263ebb67e3` represents a specific file. Through Hashlookup, we can discover:\n",
    "- What file this hash represents\n",
