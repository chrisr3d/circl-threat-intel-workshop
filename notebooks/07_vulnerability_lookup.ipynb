    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "- Pick a CPE string (or find a product with `get_vendor_products()` and derive a CPE).\n",
    "- Use `get_vulnerabilities_by_cpe(cpe)` to retrieve CVE records for that CPE.\n",
    "- Query sightings for the last 90 days with `get_sightings(date_from=..., sighting_type='exploited')`.\n",

    "- Print the top 5 CVEs with their sighting counts and published dates (from `cveMetadata`).\n",

    "Hints:\n",
    "- Use `datetime` and `timedelta(days=90)` to compute `date_from`.\n",
    "- Aggregate sightings into a dictionary, then sort by count descending.\n",
