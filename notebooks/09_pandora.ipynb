    "# Pandora Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop introduces Pandora, a comprehensive file analysis framework that provides automated malware detection and behavioral analysis through multiple security engines and analysis workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Pandora?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandora is an analysis framework to discover if a file is suspicious and conveniently show the results. It integrates multiple security analysis tools and engines to provide comprehensive file intelligence, combining static analysis, behavioral analysis, and signature-based detection to identify potential threats and provide detailed security assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tool is to provide end users, particularly those receiving documents via email, with a secure, sandboxed environment to open/preview potentially unsafe files. This approach minimizes the risk of inadvertently executing malware embedded in malicious documents (e.g., PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLSM, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Any executable file will be automatically flagged as malicious. This is based on the assumption that end users should never run executables from untrusted or unknown sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
