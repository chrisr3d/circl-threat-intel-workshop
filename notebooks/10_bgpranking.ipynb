    "# BGP-Ranking Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop introduces BGP-Ranking, a comprehensive security ranking system for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) based on malicious activity and threat intelligence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is BGP-Ranking?\n",
    "\n",
    "BGP-Ranking is a free software to calculate the security ranking of Internet Service Providers (ASNs) based on observed malicious activities and threat intelligence. The system aggregates data from multiple sources to provide risk assessments for network infrastructure, helping security professionals identify potentially compromised or malicious hosting providers and network segments.\n",
